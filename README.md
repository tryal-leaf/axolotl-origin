> ### Axolotl
>
> Axolotls are aquatic creatures that do not like leaving their watery homes.
>
> 游릭 **Play Dead:** Upon taking fatal damage, you play dead for 4 seconds. While in this state, you regenerate health but are unable to move.  
> 游릭 **Axolotl's Grace:** You can grant yourself and other players within a 12 block radius Dolphin's Grace and water breathing. However, it increases hunger consumption.  
> 游릭 **Indefatigable:** You are immune to all mining fatigue effects.  
> 游릭 **Fins:** Your underwater speed is increased.  
> 游릭 **Water Vision:** You can see perfectly underwater.  
> 游릭 **Aqua Affinity:** You may break blocks underwater as others do on land.  
> 游릭 **Like Water:** When underwater, you do not sink to the ground unless you want to.  
>
> 游리 **Ocean Spawn:** Your natural spawn is near the ocean.  
> 游리 **Half-Sized:** You are 1 block tall, half the size of a human.  
> 游리 **Piscivore:** Your diet consists of only meat, primarily fish. Raw fish give increased food and saturation, while cooked fish and other types of meat give less. Magical foods, such as Golden Apples, behave normally.  
> 游리 **Gills:** You can breathe underwater, but not on land.  
>
> 游댮 **Fragile:** You have 3 less hearts of health than humans.  
> 游댮 **Aquatic:** You take increased damage from Impaling.
